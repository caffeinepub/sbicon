However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the Publishing & Share page includes the required plain-English Custom Domain guidance checklist and disclaimers.",

      "requirement": "Add/confirm plain-English “Custom Domain” guidance on the Publishing & Share page explaining domain registration/DNS setup at registrar, propagation, and setting VITE_PUBLIC_URL + redeploying for SEO/sitemap updates, including stating the system does not purchase/register domains.",
      "reason": "The modified Publishing & Share page content is truncated and the visible portion shows hosting and URL copy logic, but does not show any Custom Domain checklist/disclaimer text required by the acceptance criteria. No other file in the diff summary includes this guidance.",
