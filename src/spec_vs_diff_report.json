  "summary": "Implemented a new Publishing/Share page routed at /publishing and linked from the main footer. The page shows the current public URL (window.location.origin), provides a copy-to-clipboard action, and displays toast feedback. However, explicit in-app text stating Google hosting is not supported is not clearly evidenced in the provided diff (page content is truncated and visible sections do not mention Google hosting).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "The Publishing / Share section contains English text stating that publishing/deployment is to the Internet Computer and that Google hosting is not supported in this project.",
      "reason": "The added page text clearly states hosting on the Internet Computer, but the visible (non-truncated) content does not explicitly say that Google hosting is not supported. The remainder of the file is truncated, so this requirement cannot be verified as implemented from the provided diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "The section displays the current public URL and includes a “Copy link” button.",
      "reason": "The URL is displayed and a copy action exists, but the control appears to be an icon-only button (Copy/Check icons) without the explicit “Copy link” label shown in the diff summary; this may not meet the stated acceptance criteria as written.",
