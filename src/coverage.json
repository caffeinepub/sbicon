        "summary": "Add a guided \"Custom Domain\" input and validation flow in the existing Publishing & Share page so users can enter the exact domain they own and see a clean, canonical URL to use for `VITE_PUBLIC_URL`.\n\nThe flow must:\n- Provide an input that accepts either a bare domain (e.g., `example.com`) or an HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).\n- Reject and show an English error message for:\n  - URLs containing a path, querystring, or fragment (e.g., `https://example.com/page?x=1`).\n  - Well-known third-party domains the user clearly does not own (at minimum block `google.com` and `www.google.com`).\n- Normalize the accepted value into a canonical HTTPS URL (e.g., `example.com` -> `https://example.com`, `https://example.com/` -> `https://example.com`).\n- Display a copy-to-clipboard control that copies an `.env` snippet line in the exact form: `VITE_PUBLIC_URL=https://example.com`.\n- Persist the entered domain value locally (e.g., localStorage) so it remains visible across reloads.\n- Include clear English guidance stating that changing the domain in the UI does not automatically connect DNS; the user must configure DNS at their registrar and then rebuild/redeploy with `VITE_PUBLIC_URL` set.",
